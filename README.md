## Introduction
WatchDHL is a pipeline for comprehensive analysis of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of longitudinal tumor pairs representing transformation of follicular lymphoma (FL) to double hit lymphoma (DHL).

## Raw sequencing datasets
* The dataset consists of a series of WGS bam files from 8 non-Hodgkin B cell lymphoma patients progressed from FL to DHL.
* The raw fastq files of this dataset are available on DBGAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs003398.v1.p1) with controlled access.
