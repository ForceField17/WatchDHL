## Introduction
WatchDHL is a pipeline for comprehensive analysis of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of longitudinal tumor pairs representing transformation of follicular lymphoma (FL) to double hit lymphoma (DHL).

## Raw sequencing datasets
* The dataset consists of a series of WGS bam files from 9 non-Hodgkin B cell lymphoma patients progressed from FL to DHL.
* All raw fastq files of this dataset have been uploaded to SRA PRJNA866386, accession will be available via application after the publishment of this work.
* Note that the "P3"" have been removed from all the above analysis base on referees' suggestion.
